Here is an upload of the main projects produced during my degree, and a short summary of each.

## mphys_project & mphys_project_summary - Simulating Binary Evolution Using Population Synthesis Suite COSMIC to Explore Neutron Star High-Mass X-Ray Binary Peculiar Velocities

This is my Master's project, produced over the course of a year. Within, I simulate a variety of star systems that result in Neutron Star High-Mass X-Ray Binaries, record the velocities at which these systems move and compare with observation. The summary was created with the goal of condensing the main project down to 2 pages, and simplifying the language used so that a layman may understand the research.

## comp_labs_project_1 - Life Supporting Orbits in a Binary Star System

This is project 1 of 2 produced for my computing module. I solved a pair of coupled differential equations numerically using python to create a variety of orbits of a planet orbiting a pair of stars. I then evaluated these orbits on whether or not they could potentially support life.

## comp_labs_project_2 - Using a Monte Carlo Simulation to Investigate Road Throughput

This is project 2 of 2 produced for my computing module. It involved creating a simple Monte-Carlo simulation of cars driving around a circular road, changing parameters related to the number of cars, driving quality etc and investigating how changing these affects the throughput of cars on the road.

## dissertation_project - The Formation of Puzzling Binary Pulsars

This is an extension of a group project, produced solo. As a group we were given the topic of Binary Pulsar Evolution and tasked with producing a presentation. After completion, each member was tasked to take the project further by themeselves and produce a paper. I chose to investigate some of the puzzling systems we came across during our research, and provide potential explanations for how these systems came to be.
